			<p><span>Name: </span>Samantha Shane C. Dollesin</p>
			<p><span>Nickname: </span>Shane</p>
			<p><span>Favorite CMSC Subject so far and why: </span>CMSC 22 because I was able to create my first games there and I was also able to utilize my design skills which I always look forward to doing in every subject.</p>
			<p><span>Favorite GE so far and why: </span>Ethics 1 because our discussions were always very insightful, but also because I just like learning philosophical concepts in general.</p>
			<p><span>Favorite programming language and why: </span>If HTML and CSS were programming languages, it would be those two. But since they aren't, I believe my favorite so far would be Java.</p>
			<p><span>Favorite food: </span>Instant noodles or anything pasta </p>
